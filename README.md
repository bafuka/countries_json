countries json file in multi-language



Lately, I have a project with a country select list in multi-language(chinese,english,french,italian,spanish,japanese,russian,germen),but I can't find a good api or json data from Internet.So I create one for myself using java script,If anyone face the same problem like me, You can take this json file and save your time.Haha...
